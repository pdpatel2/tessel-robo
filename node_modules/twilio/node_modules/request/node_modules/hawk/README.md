<img align="right" src="https://raw.github.com/hueniverse/hawk/master/images/logo.png" /> **Hawk** is an HTTP authentication scheme using a message authentication code (MAC) algorithm to provide partial
HTTP request cryptographic verification. For more complex use cases such as access delegation, see [Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz).

Current version: **2.3**

Note: 2.x is the same exact protocol as 1.1. The version increment reflects a change in the internal error format
used by the module and used by the node API.

# Introduction

**Hawk** is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with
partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host,
and optionally the request payload.

Similar to the HTTP [Digest access authentication schemes](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt), **Hawk** uses a set of
client credentials which include an identifier (e.g. username) and key (e.g. password). Likewise, just as with the Digest scheme,
the key is never included in authenticated requests. Instead, it is used to calculate a request MAC value which is
included in its place.

However, **Hawk** has several differences from Digest. In particular, while both use a nonce to limit the possibility of
replay attacks, in **Hawk** the client generates the nonce and uses it in combination with a timestamp, leading to less
"chattiness" (interaction with the server).

Also unlike Digest, this scheme is not intended to protect the key itself (the password in Digest) because
the client and server must both have access to the key material in the clear.

The primary design goals of this scheme are to:
* simplify and improve HTTP authentication for services that are unwilling or unable to deploy TLS for all resources,
* secure credentials against leakage (e.g., when the client uses some form of dynamic configuration to determine where
  to send an authenticated request), and
* avoid the exposure of credentials sent to a malicious server over an unauthenticated secure channel due to client
  failure to validate the server's identity as part of its TLS handshake.

In addition, **Hawk** supports a method for granting third-parties temporary access to individual resources using
a query parameter called _bewit_ (in falconry, a leather strap used to attach a tracking device to the leg of a hawk).

The **Hawk** scheme requires the establishment of a shared symmetric key between the client and the server,
which is beyond the scope of this module. Typically, the shared credentials are established via an initial
TLS-protected phas
